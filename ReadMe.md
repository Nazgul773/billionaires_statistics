## Introduction 
Embark on a comprehensive journey into the world of global billionaires through a two-step process. In the initial phase, the dataset undergoes rigorous cleaning, focusing on standardizing column names, handling missing data, addressing duplicates, and managing outliers. This ensures the dataset's accuracy and reliability for subsequent analysis. The refined dataset is then stored for further exploration in the second step, where an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) unfolds.
